### About `csbCreate.csv`
These data are a modified version of the original Citizens' Service Bureau Data release dated 02/17/2016. Data were manually extracted from the original release and then slightly modified for the purposes of this assignment. Several variables were dropped to limit the file size to less than 100GB (to comply with GitHub policy on file size). Observations prior to January 1, 2009 and after December 31, 2015 were removed. The code to create this dataset is included. **You do not need to execute this code. It uses legacy Stata processes that are no longer part of the course. It is provided solely for reference, reproducibility, and transparency.** The output that it generated is included as well for reference.

### About SOC 4650 & 5650: Introduction to GIS
This class introduces both the theoretical and technical skills that constitute the nascent field of Geographic Information Science (GISc). Techniques introduced include data cleaning and management, map production and cartography, and the manipulation of both tabular and spatial data. The impacts of GISc on public policy, and the effects of public policy on GISc, are also discussed. The course incorporates a wide variety of social, economic, health, urban, meteorological, and environmental data. These data are mapped at a variety of extents, from the City of St. Louis to the St. Louis Metropolitan region, Missouri, all United States counties, and all U.S. states. More details are available on the [course website](https://slu-soc5650.github.io).
